-In my own words, a zine is a self-made “pamphlet” using easily accessible items to share content with the masses. Some say a zine is derived from the word magazine, but I’ve also seen that as being a false assumption and comes from the word “fanzine”.  An article by the University of Texas libraries cites the Oxford English Dictionary as saying the word “zine’’ is shortened from the word fanzine. I was unable to verify this due to a subscription requirement for the Oxford English Dictionary.

-When researching where zines come from the date, you’ll see is 1930’s, but I believe they’ve appeared long before that. I’m pretty sure zines were used as a way to share propaganda, but this is just my thoughts. According the Chapel Hill Rare Book Blog zines were created in the science fiction fandoms of the 1930s. Because of this, the name fanzine, which is short for fan magazine and then shortened even more to zine.

-People compose zines as a way to express their thoughts, beliefs, experiences and knowledge at an uncensored level. This was a way of expression at a level of the common people. Another reason zine is so popular is that they are low cost, easily made and distributed. 

-Zines are a glimpse into history through the eyes of the average person whereas the media’s documentation publishes with restrictions and constraints. Media might say, for example, oppression is at an all-time low, but in all reality that is not the case. A zine is more likely to express the truth or the behind the screens, if you will. 

-Zines give an in-depth perspective to the author. The subject matter is usually important to the author and gives an understanding to what they consider important enough to share with the pubic. Sometimes the author has an agenda and use zines as a way to have their “voice” heard. You can tell the audience based on the zine. For example, my group has chosen a do it yourself zine on making a Pumpkin Keg. This is obviously intended for adults who put on social gatherings, enjoy drinking and want to be festive while being unique. This isn’t something you’d share with a child nor would they have much interest in it.
-The context of a zine can share the authors personality and views. Is the author mocking something or are they supporting the content of the zine? The design of the zine also says a lot about the author and supports the context in which they’ve written it. Are the images hand drawn or are they photographic, maybe they don’t have images at all!

-I couldn’t find much, if anything, about rules on zines other than every post saying there isn’t rules. What I did find was a .pdf from zinebooks.com which gave me the best guidelines. It appears that size does matter in the zine community. The average piece of paper folded and stapled. This makes it easier to share, mail, carry and reproduce. When papers are just stapled together, they give off a boring essay feel that doesn’t intrigue the readers.
-The pages need to have a visual appeal, have a balance to the pages and use pictures or illustrations. The more appealing to the eye the more likely someone will read it. Font can be important when using a lot of text. It’s recommended to use a basic font like Times to make it easier on the eye when reading it. Some freedom of expression can be used in the titles, quotes, headline and captions. This is sure to grab attention.
-Using artwork is a must for zines. This artwork can be drawings, photos or clippings from old books and magazines. These are used to entice readers and to help convey the context of the work. One fact I found important was about recreating the zine. If using a photograph, it might be better to have it professionally recreated through a company like Kinkos. The photographs will fade and become blurred when photocopied many times at home. This is where the average zine creator should consider using lined drawing which can easily be copied and isn’t a victim of darken and muddy artwork from the copier.
-Editing is important but not just for errors but to keep the zine short, sweet and to the point. This helps the reader believe in your zine and not get confused or offended by the words chosen unless specifically chosen.
